# Awesome-Scene-Change-Detection(SCD)

This repo contains a curative list of **scene change detection(SCD)**, including papers, videos, codes, and related websites. 

_NOTE. This repository covers scene change detection based on robot vision (Especially image and point cloud data, etc.). Many change detection papers focus on the remote sensing domain, but this repo will only list works that have been tested on street-view scenes._
